Promotional graphics for the application were created on Krita, and the GIFs are extracted off Tenor API. 

On the backend, various NodeJS frameworks, including *Electron*, *node-fetch*, and *dotenv*, made this application feasible overall.

Moreover, *Express*, *express-rate-limit*, *node-fetch*, and *Render* were used to configure the server that delivers the GIFs to clients. [See  source code for the server setup.](https://github.com/erenoguzyesil/meowery-server)

Lastly, the application was packaged and made distributable through *electron-builder*.
